# MyReads Project (FWD)

- I have used React.js fundamentals with hooks and api to create this app
- This app is divided into reusble components
- The two main components are "MainPage" and "SearchPage"
- There are smaller components that have been used more than once such as "BooksShelf" and "Book"
- You can move books between shelfs
- In Search Page You can search for any book and move books to main page
